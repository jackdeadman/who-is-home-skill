# Who is home?
An Amazon Alexa skill to check which residents are currently at home.

## Installation
This skill is intended to work on a Raspberry Pi (probably can work on anything supporting docker though). Firstly install docker and docker-compose. You can install these by following this [tutorial](https://dev.to/rohansawant/installing-docker-and-docker-compose-on-the-raspberry-pi-in-5-simple-steps-3mgl).

## Functionality

### Webapp
View who is currenly located in the house using the web application.

## Security
Obviously knowing who is currently located in the house could lead to a potential security issue. The only endpoint that is publically assessible is the one needed for the Amazon Alexa skill, this endpoint requires a signature from Amazon which is verified.
